#+title: Primitive Ds

This is C++ specific for the most part.
Also assumes a 64-bit system

* Basic Data Types
** int
- Default size: 4-bytes
- Stores numbers for binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal base systems.
- Ranges: -2,147,483,648 -> 2,147,483,647
** float
- Default size: 4-bytes
- Stores decimals
- Ranges: 1.2e-38 -> 3.4e+38
** double
- Default size: 8-bytes
- Has higher precision than a float
- Ranges: 1.7e-308 -> 1.7e+308
** char
- Default size: 1-byte
- Stores a single character (letter)
** bool
- Default size: 1-byte
- Either 0 or 1 (false or true)
** void
- Absence of a type.
- Can only be used for pointers and functions.
* Derived Data Types
** array
** pointer
** reference
** function
* User Defined Data Types
** class
** structure
** union
** typedef
** using


* Data Type Modifiers
Keyword used to change or give extra meaning to already exisitng data types.
** short
**Can only be used with int**
Decreases the size of the date type in the memory.
So, instead of a 4-byte int it becomes a 2-byte int
** long
**Can only be used with int**
Increases the size of the data type in the memory.
So, instead of a 4-byte int it becomes an 8-byte int.
** signed
**Can only be used with int and char types**
Indicates that the variable can be negative and/or positive.
** unsigned
**Can only be used with int and char types**
Indicates that the variable can only be non-negative.
