#+title: Binary Search

* Example Scenario
Finding a word in a dictionary. Given that all dictionaries are sorted alphabetically, you realistically don't need to flip through the whole book to find the word you're looking for. You can just flip open a random page, look at the letter you see, and decide whether to go forward or backward.


** When to use this algorithm?
- This algorithm ONLY works when the list is sorted.
- When you need to find an element in an array or something

This algorithm is O(log2(n)).

* Simple Python Code
#+begin_src python
def binary_search(nums, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        guess = nums[mid]

        if guess == target:
            return mid
        if guess > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1

    return None
#+end_src


* Exercises
- Suppose a list of 128 names, whats the max number of steps it would take?
  log2(128) = 7
- Suppose the list size is doubled, whats the max now?
  Literally just previous answer + 1, therefore 8
